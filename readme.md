# Introduction

I like [Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/).

And, I using Picasa on Desktop.

I watching tags on Picasa and Danbooru.

I tried to develop application that collaborates both personality.

But, Picasa using unknown databases.

I can't insert Danbooru's informations into that databases.

So, I need to switch of the shipment.

Sankaku Watch is that answer for problem.

I thought to create new database format.

Sankaku Watch is API wrapper for crawling on Danbooru Databases.

# Future Prospects

I think Danbooru (and Danbooru System) is integrated P2P technology.

Danbooru's problem weigh heavily on one retains Crowd Storage.

P2P technology is solving this problem.

But, I can't implement P2P.

I want that someone make it.
